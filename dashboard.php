                    5. Deleting computer files and changing the set-up of the computer is a major offense.

                    6. Observe computer time usage carefully. A fifteen-minute allowance is given for each use. Otherwise, the unit will be given to those who wish to "sit-in".

                    7. Observe proper decorum while inside the laboratory.
                    a. Do not get inside the lab unless the instructor is present.
                    b. All bags, knapsacks, and the likes must be deposited at the counter.
                    c. Follow the seating arrangement of your instructor.
                    d. At the end of class, all software programs must be closed.
                    e. Return all chairs to their proper places after using.

                    8. Chewing gum, eating, drinking, smoking, and other forms of vandalism are prohibited inside the lab.

                    9. Anyone causing a continual disturbance will be asked to leave the lab. Acts or gestures offensive to the members of the community, including public display of physical intimacy, are not tolerated.

                    10. Persons exhibiting hostile or threatening behavior such as yelling, swearing, or disregarding requests made by lab personnel will be asked to leave the lab.

                    11. For serious offense, the lab personnel may call the Civil Security Office (CSU) for assistance.

                    12. Any technical problem or difficulty must be addressed to the laboratory supervisor, student assistant or instructor immediately.

                    <b>DISCIPLINARY ACTION</b>
